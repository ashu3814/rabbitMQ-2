# E-commerce Flow Demo with RabbitMQ

A microservices-based e-commerce system demonstration using NestJS and RabbitMQ, showcasing event-driven architecture with retry mechanisms and dead letter queues.

## System Architecture

The system consists of the following microservices:

1. **Order Service**: Handles order creation and initiates the order processing flow
2. **Payment Service**: Processes payments for created orders
3. **Inventory Service**: Updates stock levels after successful payment
4. **Shipping Service**: Manages shipment creation with retry mechanism
5. **Notification Service**: Sends notifications for order and payment events

## Message Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Order Service] -->|order.created| B[Payment Service]
    A -->|order.created| C[Notification Service]
    B -->|payment.processed.successful| D[Inventory Service]
    B -->|payment.processed.successful| E[Shipping Service]
    B -->|payment.processed.*| C
    E -->|shipping.failed| F[Retry Queue]
    F -->|After Delay| E
    F -->|Max Retries Exceeded| G[Dead Letter Queue]
```

## RabbitMQ Setup

The system uses the following RabbitMQ components:

- **Exchange**: `ecommerce.events` (topic)
- **Queues**:
  - `notification.service.order.created`
  - `payment.service.order.created`
  - `inventory.service.payment.successful`
  - `shipping.service.queue`
  - `shipping.service.retry.queue`
  - `shipping.service.final.dlq`

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (Latest LTS version)
- RabbitMQ Server running locally on port 5672
- npm or yarn package manager

## Project Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Ensure RabbitMQ is running locally:
```bash
# Windows (if installed as a service)
net start RabbitMQ

# Linux/MacOS
brew services start rabbitmq  # for MacOS with Homebrew
systemctl start rabbitmq-server  # for Linux
```

## Running the Application

1. Start the application in development mode:
```bash
npm run start:dev
```

2. The application will:
   - Set up all required RabbitMQ exchanges and queues
   - Start all microservices
   - Listen on port 3000 for HTTP requests

## Testing the Flow

1. Create a new order by sending a POST request to `/orders`:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/orders -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "customerId": "CUST123",
  "customerEmail": "customer@example.com",
  "items": [
    {
      "productId": "PROD123",
      "quantity": 1,
      "price": 29.99
    }
  ],
  "totalAmount": 29.99
}'
```

2. The system will:
   - Generate a unique orderId and correlationId
   - Publish an order.created event
   - Process the payment
   - Update inventory
   - Create shipment (with retry mechanism if needed)
   - Send notifications at each step

## Error Handling and Retries

The shipping service includes a sophisticated retry mechanism:
- Failed shipments are sent to a retry queue with a delay
- After the delay, messages are reprocessed
- After maximum retries, messages go to a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)

## Development

```bash
# Run tests
npm run test

# Run e2e tests
npm run test:e2e

# Generate test coverage
npm run test:cov
```

## Monitoring

Monitor the flow through the logs, which include:
- Correlation IDs for request tracing
- Event publishing and consumption details
- Service processing status
- Retry attempts for failed operations
